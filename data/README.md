# Project: Can you recognize the emotion from an image of a face?

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in particular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

This data includes a .csv file with labels for facial features for the bank of photos used to build the training model. 
Features accompanying the photo data are also included in .mat files. The photos themselves are proprietary and not included.
