### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

The main_pred file is the file used to run our optimized model on the test data.

The main_train file is the file used to select the optimal model based on training data. We tested used KNN as a baseline and compared it to a PCA-optimized KNN model, logistic regression, GBM, random forest, and xgboost.

The normalization text file provides a bit of context on the normalization embedded in our models.
